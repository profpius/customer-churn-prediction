## 📌 Business Problem

Customer churn is one of the most costly challenges in subscription-based and retail businesses. Acquiring a new customer can cost **5 to 10× more** than retaining an existing one, yet most companies lack a systematic, data-driven early warning system.

This project addresses that gap by building a **production-ready machine learning pipeline** that:

- Identifies customers at high risk of churning **before** they leave
- Quantifies the exact business levers driving churn (loyalty points, membership tier, complaint history)
- Delivers a **serialised, deployment-ready pipeline** that scores new customers in real time
- Surfaces predictions and SHAP explanations through a **live, interactive web application** accessible to non-technical stakeholders

The model enables retention teams to take **targeted, cost-efficient action** instead of blanketing the entire customer base with expensive campaigns.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Raw data quality issues were handled systematically before any modelling step:

**Issues identified:**
- `'?'` placeholder strings masking missing values across multiple columns
- `avg_frequency_login_days` stored as `object` dtype instead of numeric
- Identifier and datetime columns (`security_no`, `referral_id`, `joining_date`, `last_visit_time`) with no predictive signal

**Steps taken:**
1. Replaced all `'?'` values with `np.nan` for proper imputation
2. Coerced `avg_frequency_login_days` to numeric using `pd.to_numeric(errors='coerce')`
3. Dropped non-predictive identifier and timestamp columns
4. Separated features and target **before any preprocessing** to prevent data leakage

All subsequent preprocessing (imputation, scaling, encoding) was applied **exclusively within a fitted sklearn Pipeline**, guaranteeing that no information from the test set was used during training.

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key patterns surfaced during EDA that directly informed the modelling strategy:

**Churn by Membership Tier:** Customers with no membership or basic membership exhibited the highest churn rates (approximately 90 to 95%), while premium-tier customers were nearly fully retained. This confirmed `membership_category` as a high-signal feature.

**Wallet Points vs. Churn:** Churned customers held significantly fewer loyalty points on average than retained customers, suggesting the rewards programme is a meaningful retention mechanism.

**Transaction Value & Engagement:** Lower average spend and reduced login frequency were both strongly correlated with churn, indicating disengagement precedes cancellation by a measurable window.

**Feedback Sentiment:** Customers who rated their experience as "Poor Customer Support" or "Too Many Pop-ups" churned at significantly higher rates than those who gave positive feedback.

---

## ⚙️ Feature Engineering

No manual feature construction was required. Instead, engineering was embedded directly in the preprocessing pipeline:

- **Numeric features:** Median imputation (robust to outliers) → `StandardScaler`
- **Categorical features:** Most-frequent imputation → `OrdinalEncoder` with `handle_unknown='use_encoded_value'` to handle unseen categories at inference time
- **Pipeline architecture:** All transformations were bundled in a `ColumnTransformer` and wrapped within `sklearn Pipeline` objects to prevent leakage and ensure single-call production inference

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

Three models were trained and compared, each wrapped in a full preprocessing + classifier `Pipeline`:

### 1. Logistic Regression *(Interpretable Baseline)*
- `class_weight='balanced'` to account for any residual class imbalance
- `max_iter=1000` to ensure convergence
- Serves as a linearity benchmark

### 2. Random Forest *(Ensemble Baseline)*
- 100 estimators, `class_weight='balanced'`
- Captures non-linear feature interactions without gradient boosting

### 3. XGBoost *(Selected Best Model)*
- Tuned via `RandomizedSearchCV` with Stratified 3-Fold CV
- Key tuned parameters: `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `learning_rate`, `subsample`, `colsample_bytree`
- `scale_pos_weight` set to handle class imbalance natively

## 📈 Model Performance

### Hold-Out Test Set Results

| Model | F1 Score | ROC-AUC | Accuracy |
|---|---|---|---|
| Logistic Regression | 78.90% | 82.60% | 79.20% |
| Random Forest | 93.80% | 97.50% | 93.30% |
| **XGBoost** | **94.01%** | **97.60%** | **93.47%** |

### Stratified 5-Fold Cross-Validation

Cross-validation confirmed that XGBoost's performance is **stable and generalisable**, not an artefact of a favourable random seed.

| Model | CV F1 (Mean ± Std) | CV ROC-AUC (Mean ± Std) |
|---|---|---|
| Logistic Regression | 78.70% ± 0.38% | 82.47% ± 0.36% |
| Random Forest | 93.73% ± 0.43% | 97.44% ± 0.11% |
| **XGBoost** | **93.80% ± 0.31%** | **97.55% ± 0.13%** |

**Why F1 over Accuracy?**
In churn prediction, a false negative (missing a true churner) is costly; the company loses a customer entirely. A false positive (flagging a retained customer) wastes a targeted retention offer. F1 penalises both equally, making it the correct optimisation target for this business problem.

## 💡 Key Insights and Business Impact

### Top Churn Drivers (SHAP-Verified)

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used to provide directional, per-prediction feature attribution, going beyond aggregate importance scores.

| Rank | Feature | Direction | Business Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `points_in_wallet` | Low → High churn | Loyalty rewards are the single strongest retention lever |
| 2 | `membership_category` | Basic/None → High churn | Premium membership dramatically reduces churn risk |
| 3 | `avg_transaction_value` | Low → High churn | High-value customers have greater product stickiness |
| 4 | `feedback` | Negative → High churn | Poor support experience is a leading churn indicator |
| 5 | `avg_frequency_login_days` | Less active → High churn | Platform disengagement precedes cancellation |

### Business Recommendations

**1. 💰 Launch a wallet top-up campaign.** Target customers with `points_in_wallet` below the model-identified risk threshold with bonus points or cashback to increase perceived loyalty programme value.

**2. 🎖️ Offer tiered membership upgrades.** Customers in "No Membership" and "Basic Membership" categories churn at approximately 90 to 95%. Subsidised trial upgrades to Silver or Gold could significantly shift retention rates.

**3. 🛠️ Prioritise complaint resolution.** Customers with unresolved complaints and negative feedback are at immediate churn risk. A dedicated fast-track resolution queue for flagged customers would have high ROI.

**4. ⚡ Automate real-time churn scoring.** The serialised pipeline powers the live Streamlit app and can also be integrated into any CRM or data warehouse for daily automated risk scoring and proactive outreach.

**Estimated Business Value:** If the model flags 1,000 at-risk customers monthly and a targeted retention campaign recovers 30% of them at an average LTV of ₦500,000 per customer, the recovered revenue is ₦150,000,000/month — from a model trained entirely on existing data.

print(f"Churn Probability: {prob * 100:.1f}%")
```

## ⚠️ Deployment Notes

Deploying a serialised sklearn pipeline across environments requires careful version matching. Key lessons from this project:

- **sklearn/XGBoost version mismatch** is the most common cause of `AttributeError` when loading `.pkl` files. The serialised model must be trained with the **exact same library versions** that will be used at inference time.
- **Streamlit Community Cloud** does not honour `runtime.txt` for Python version pinning — the platform controls the Python version independently.
- **Resolution workflow:** Check the Streamlit Cloud build logs to find the exact versions it installed → reinstall those exact versions in your training environment (Colab) → retrain → resave the `.pkl` → redeploy. This guarantees environment parity.
- **Current production versions:** `scikit-learn==1.8.0`, `xgboost==3.2.0`

---

## 🔭 Future Improvements

- **Threshold Optimisation:** Apply a custom decision threshold (e.g., 0.35 instead of 0.50) calibrated to the business cost ratio of false negatives vs. false positives
- **Feature Engineering:** Engineer time-based features from `joining_date` and `last_visit_time` (e.g., recency, days since last visit) which were dropped in this iteration
- **Calibrated Probabilities:** Apply Platt Scaling or Isotonic Regression to ensure predicted probabilities are well-calibrated for reliable risk scoring
- **REST API Deployment:** Wrap the serialised pipeline in a FastAPI service for real-time scoring via HTTP requests
- **CRM Integration:** Connect the pipeline to a CRM or data warehouse for automated daily churn scoring
- **Drift Monitoring:** Implement data drift detection using Evidently AI to alert when the incoming customer distribution shifts from the training distribution
